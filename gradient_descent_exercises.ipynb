Adjust  the number of iterations in the provided code for this section until you get this answer (note that the loss may print out as 0 before you reach the correct answer due to rounding). The loss here can be 0 because we have one sample and we can adjust the weight to get that exact answer; normally the loss won't be 0.\n",
